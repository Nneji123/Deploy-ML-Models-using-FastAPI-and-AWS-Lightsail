## About the files
### app.py
This file contains the important source code for building and running our FastAPI application. This is what the file contains:

The API has three endpoints;
The GET endpoint '/' which is just the homepage
The '/document-classifier' endpoint. This endpoint takes a PDF file as input and then returns a JSON response with the classes the PDF file belongs to.
The '/classify-image' endpoint. This endpoint takes an image file as input and then returns a JSON response with the classes the image file belongs to.

### docker-compose.yml
A docker-compose. yml is a config file for Docker Compose. It allows to deploy, combine, and configure multiple docker containers at the same time. In this case I used it to run the Docker container for the project locally.

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile contains all the commands needed to to build and run our Docker image.

The Dockerfile  performs the following steps:
- Grabs the python:3.8.13-slim-bullseye image from Docker hub. This is called the base image.
- Creates a work directory called app.
- Installs the poppler-utils package. This package is needed by Linux in order for us to work with and manipulate PDF files.
- Upgrades the setuptools library
- Installs the CPU version of Pytorch and other requirements.
- Copies all the files from our current directory to the Docker builder.
- Exposes the port 8000. This is a very important step that allows our container to be visible on AWS Lightsail.
- Runs the download.py file.
- Launches the FastAPI application using uvicorn.

### download.py
This file downloads the pre-trained model from Hugging Face.

### requirements.txt
This file contains the necessary  requirements for our API.

### utils.py
This file contains the functions that generate the classifications for the PDF and image files.

 


## How to run the Application :question:

<details> 
  <summary><b>Running on Local Machine with Docker Compose</b></summary>

**You can also run the application in a docker container using docker compose(if you have it installed)**

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nneji123/Deploy-ML-Models-using-FastAPI-and-AWS-Lightsail.git
```

2. Change the directory:
```
cd Deploy-ML-Models-using-FastAPI-and-AWS-Lightsail
```



3. Run the docker compose command
```docker
docker compose up --build 
```
And then you should be able to view the API on port 8080
